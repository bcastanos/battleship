# Battleship

---

Welcome to my Project 1 readme. For my first project I created a 2 player Battleship game.

## Rules

- Each player takes a turn in selecting a square to see if they have hit a ship.
- If a player hits a ship, they get to take another turn to attempt to completely find the ship.
- Once all ships have been revealed, the player with the highest score wins.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery were used in the making of this game.

## Approach Taken

I started the creation of my game by laying out the game board, creating div's for all the elements that would be interacted with or require updating as the game progressed. In order to create the ship locations, I created functions that would generate arrays referring to the boxes that the ship objects would be populated in. To prevent the ships from overlapping, I mapped out the board and created the formulae so that each ship could only appear in a certain zone.

## Unsolved Problems

With a little more time, I would have created pop ups to signify when a ship was found in its entirety. Also, I would have figured the reset function completely.
